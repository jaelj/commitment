			<center><h2><strong><u>What Is Commitment</u></strong></h2></center>

			<p>Definition: A person's thoughts and conscious reactions to events, perceived as a continuous flow.</p>
		
			<br>

			<p>Committing to a project is of utmost importance as it requires a person to devote all of their time and energy to the project or event. When you commit you are making a promise to yourself and the project that you will do it because you care want to complete it. </p>
		
			<br>

			<p>Commitment will only prove rewarding if one chooses to invest their time and energy into something they are passionate about. Passion is the main driving force and without it commitments are often unsuccessful. </p>

			<center><h2><u>In Action</u></h2></center>

			<p>Committing to Git is updating your version frequently so you have a mass store of all the changes so that you can go back to any point at any time in chance that something breaks. It is making the said promise to go through with what you’re doing but still being open to whatever you’re doing. Openness to new or changing ideas is imperative when committing to something as projects often never end up the way one imagines they will in the beginning. </p>

			<br>

			<p>People must make a conscious decision to take action regularly when using Git to save changes. Uploading changes from Git to GitHub makes sharing these changes a commitment between people who work on said project. Through regular use of Git and GitHub, one will be able to enter a state of flow with their work and others will be able to get on it too to join in on the commitment. </p>
