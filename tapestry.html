		<h2><strong><u>What is Commitment</u></strong></h2>
		<p>Definition: A person's thoughts and conscious reactions to events, perceived as a continuous flow.</p>
		<p>Commiting to a project is of utmost importance as it requires a person to devote all of their time and energy to the project or event.</p>
		<p>Commitment will only prove rewarding if one chooses to invest their time and energy into something they are passionate about.</p>

		<h2><u>In Action</u></h2>
		<p>Committing to Git is updating your version frequently so you have a mass store of all the changes so that you can go back to any point at any time in chance that something breaks. </p>
		<p>It is making a promise to go through with what your doing but still being open to whatever youâ€™re doing. </p>
		<p>People must make a conscious decision to take action regularly when using Git to save changes. Uploading changes from Git to Github makes sharing these changes a commitment between people who work on said project.</p>
		<p>Through regular use of Git and Github, one will be able to enter a state of flow with their work and others will be able to get on it to if used as a commitment.</p>
